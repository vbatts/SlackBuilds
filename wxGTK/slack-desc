wxGTK:	wxWidgets lets developers create applications for
wxGTK:	Win32, Mac OS X, GTK+, X11, Motif, WinCE, and more using
wxGTK:	one codebase. It can be used from languages such as
wxGTK:	C++, Python, Perl, and C#/.NET. Unlike other cross-
wxGTK:	platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and
wxGTK:	feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses the 
wxGTK:	platform's own native controls rather than emulating them.
