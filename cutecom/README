CuteCom

CuteCom is a graphical serial terminal, like minicom (or Hyperterminal
on Windows, but I don't want to compare CuteCom to it, since
Hyperterminal is really one of the worst applications I know).

It is aimed mainly at hardware developers or other people who need
a terminal to talk to their devices. It is free software and
distributed under the GNU General Public License Version 2, which
can find in the file COPYING. It is written using the Qt library
by Trolltech.
