FUSE is a simple interface for userspace programs to export
a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to
provide a secure method for non privileged users to create
and mount their own filesystem implementations.

You'll need to start fuse from rc.local with something like this:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.fuse ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.fuse start
  fi
