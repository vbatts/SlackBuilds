sslstrip (HTTPS ssl stripping)

This tool provides a demonstration of the HTTPS stripping attacks.
It will transparently hijack HTTP traffic on a network, watch for
HTTPS links and redirects, then map those links into either
look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links. 

requires: pyOpenSSL and python-twisted-web2 (which require pysetuptools,
          zope.interface, and python-twisted)
