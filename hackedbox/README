hackedbox (the bastard son of blackbox)

Hackedbox is a stripped down version of Blackbox - 
The X11 Window Manager (http://blackboxwm.sourceforge.net/). 
The toolbar and Slit have been removed. The goal of 
Hackedbox is to be a small "feature-set" window manager, 
with no bloat. There are no plans to add any functionality, 
only bugfixes and speed enhancements whenever possible.
