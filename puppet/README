puppet (data center automation)

Puppet abstracts the system from the system administration,
providing developers and system administrators with a simple
service-based policy framework that allows for more consistent,
transparent and flexible systems.

There are manpages, but the project's wiki pages have much
additional material.

See http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/ for more information
on getting started using puppet and a reference guide.
