# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdbi:
libdbi: libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, 
libdbi: similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of 
libdbi: code, programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and 
libdbi: multiple simultaneous database connections by using this framework.
