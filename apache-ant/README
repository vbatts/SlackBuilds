Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool - like make, but without make's
wrinkles.  :-)

Ant is extended using Java classes. The configuration files are XML- based,
calling out a target tree where tasks get executed. Each task is run by an
object that implements a Task interface.

You can pass the environment variable of ANT_HOME if it is different that /usr/share/ant
