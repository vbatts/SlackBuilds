apache-tomcat (java serlets server)

An Open Source JSP and Servlet Container
from the Apache Foundation

just add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tomcat ] ; then
  sh /etc/rc.d/rc.tomcat start
fi

and add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tomcat ] ; then
  sh /etc/rc.d/rc.tomcat stop
fi

The server is by default on listens port 8080
and this is configured in /srv/tomcat/conf/
 * server.xml and friends

Additionally there is an environment variable 
 configuration at /etc/tomcat-setenv.conf
 which is helpful for setting options for 
 some of the servlets as well.
 Like for hudson, you can include 
 "-DHUDSON_HOME=/var/lib/hudson" in the 
 CATALINA_OPTS to write the files to a directory other 
 than $TOMCAT_HOME/.hudson/
