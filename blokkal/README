Blokkal is an extendable KDE Blogging Client that supports multiple protocols
and blogging sites. The goal is to provide a uniform way to access the 
most-commonly-used blogging systems. It has been designed for a maximum of 
modularity allowing for easy extension. 	
		
Features

Blokkal is capable of creating new entries as well as loading and editing 
entries that have already been posted into a blog. Additionally, new 
entries can be posted into multiple blogs at the same time and entries can 
be previewed before being posted. A couple of formatting options help to 
apply some common text formattings while editing the HTML-code of an entry,
while syntax-highlighting aids in ensuring correct code. There exist 
dialogs that help inserting links and images, which can be dragged and 
dropped into the editor from other applications such as webbrowsers.

Currently the following protocols are supported:

    * LiveJournal
    * Blogger 1.0
    * Blogger/GData
    * MetaWeblog API
    * MovableType
