# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cutecom: CuteCom is a graphical serial terminal, like minicom (or
cutecom: Hyperterminal on Windows, but I don't want to compare CuteCom to it,
cutecom: since Hyperterminal is really one of the worst applications I know).
