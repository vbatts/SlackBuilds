wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI 
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native
platform's controls and utilities.

This SlackBuild is meant to be used for compilation of applications
compatible with the 2.6.x wxWidget releases (aMule, for example).
This is a unicode shared build.
