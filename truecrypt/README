dependencies:
  * wxGTK
  * fuse

TrueCrypt requires you to agree to their Licensing before downloading,
so there is not a direct link, therefor the DOWNLOAD link in truecrypt.info, will not work for you.
To get the source bundle, 
 + go to "http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads2.php", 
 + in the top drop box, choose the 'tar.gz' instead of 'zip'
 + to the right of the License box, check the 'I Agree' box
 + the click the 'Download' button between the two.



you'll need to have the wxGTK-2.8.7.tar.gz source in this CWD
because truecrypt builds against the wxGTK source, wxGTK doesn't have to been installed,
just the source code needs to be present.
this particular truecrypt.SlackBuild looks to /tmp/SBo/wxGTK-2.8.7/
