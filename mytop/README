mytop - a top clone for MySQL

mytop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads
and overall performance of a MySQL 3.22.x, 3.23.x, and 4.x server.
It runs on most Unix systems (including Mac OS X) which have Perl,
DBI, and Term::ReadKey installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed
you even get color. If you install Time::HiRes, you'll get good
real-time queries/second stats.

Requires: Term::ReadKey (perl-TermReadKey)
