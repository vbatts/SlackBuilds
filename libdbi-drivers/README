The libdbi-drivers project maintains drivers for the libdbi database
abstraction layer written in C. Drivers are distributed seperately
from the library itself.

This includes the drivers for mysql and sqlite by default. 
if the PGSQL="true" variable is set, then postgresql will is 
required and will be built as well.

This requires libdbi.
