x11-ssh-askpass is an X11-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.


** HOWTO **
to utilize this service, you will need a key in $HOME/.ssh/, 
like an id_rsa or id_dsa
and permissions need to be `chmod 700 $HOME/.ssh/ `
if you log on using kdm, then just create the file $HOME/.xprofile
with following contents,
<xprofile>
#!/bin/sh
 
usessh=yes

if test "$usessh" = "yes" -a -d /home/vbatts/.ssh ; then
  SSH_ASKPASS="/usr/libexec/x11-ssh-askpass"
  if [ -x  ] ; then 
    export SSH_ASKPASS
    ssh-agent > $HOME/.ssh/agent
    . $HOME/.ssh/agent
    ssh-add
  fi
fi

</xprofile>

if you are launching X from console then you can edit your $HOME/.xinitrc 
to source $HOME/.xprofile file, or just add the previous contents to it.
