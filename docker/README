Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs,
bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

to use docker as a limited user, add your user to the 'docker' group

 	#> groupadd -r -g 278 docker
	#> usermod -a -G docker <your_username>

This will require log out and login

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time, and is not needed for
runtime.
