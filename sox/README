SoX, the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs. 

SoX is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS X, etc.) command
line utility that can convert various formats of computer audio
files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to
these sound files, and, as an added bonus, SoX can play and
record audio files on most platforms.
