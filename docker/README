Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs,
bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time, and is not needed for
runtime.
