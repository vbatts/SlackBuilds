  with no args, it will show all.
  or for each arg it will search the package names.
  the args support regex

  this expects an arg(s), and will output, in grep fashion
  packages matching your search args.
  the args support regex

  or for each arg it will search the package names.
  the args support regex

sll - list the contents of packages matching the
  strings passed as args

slo - find conf files, that were installed as .new
  suffixed, that have been orphaned and left behind.

  expects 1 argument passed. 


TODO: 
2010-08-20 09:16 <bailey> which is that I need to run a query to show me what packages I'm running are 
	different than the slack-current versions
2010-08-20 09:16 <bailey> since I make local ones and forget about it
