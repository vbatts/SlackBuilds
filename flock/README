flock (social mozilla web browser)

Flock is a free web browser. Built on Mozilla's Firefox,
Flock enables you to instantly upload photos,
share photos and videos.

This build script was adapted from slackware's 
mozilla-firefox.SlackBuild, and therefore does not 
compile flock but repackages the binaries.
