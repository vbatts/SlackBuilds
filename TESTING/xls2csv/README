xls2csv - A script that recodes a spreadsheet's charset and saves as CSV

DESCRIPTION:
This script will recode a spreadsheet into a different 
character set and output the recoded data as a csv file.
The script came about after many headaches from dealing 
with Excel spreadsheets from clients that were being 
received in various character sets.

DEPENDENCIES:
* Locale::Recode
* Unicode::Map
* Spreadsheet::ParseExcel ( http://search.cpan.org/~szabgab/Spreadsheet-ParseExcel-0.33/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseExcel.pm )
* Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::FmtUnicode (should be included with Spreadsheet::ParseExcel)
