# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdbi-drivers: libdbi-drivers (Database Drivers for libdbi)
libdbi-drivers:
libdbi-drivers: libdbi-drivers implements a database-independent abstraction layer 
libdbi-drivers: in C, similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of 
libdbi-drivers: code, programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and 
libdbi-drivers: multiple simultaneous database connections by using this framework.
