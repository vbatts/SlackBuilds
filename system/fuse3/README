fuse3 - Filesystem in Userspace, version 3

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs to
export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists of two
components: the fuse kernel module (maintained in the regular kernel
repositories) and the libfuse userspace library (maintained in this
repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation for communicating
with the FUSE kernel module.

This ought not collide with the "fuse" package in stock slackware install.
